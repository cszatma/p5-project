# p5-project

A simple app that demonstrates [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## Usage

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to manage dependencies.

In the root directory run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

To build the app run `yarn build`, this will generate a build/ directory
and a file named index.bundle.js.

Open public/index.html and you should see the app working.
